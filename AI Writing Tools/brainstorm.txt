STRICT CHARACTER NAME INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST use ONLY the exact character names provided in: === CHARACTERS === through === END CHARACTERS === section, if provided
- DO NOT create any new character names not in: === CHARACTERS === through === END CHARACTERS ===
- DO NOT modify, expand, or add to the character names in any way (no adding first/last names, titles, etc.)
- Keep the exact capitalization/title case of each name as provided
- If a character has only a first name or nickname in the list, use ONLY that exact name
- If a character is referred to differently in different parts of the ideas file, use ONLY the specific format provided in the list

BACKGROUND CHARACTER INSTRUCTIONS:
- For incidental characters who briefly appear in scenes (cashiers, waiters, doormen, passersby, etc.), refer to them ONLY by their role or function (e.g., "the cashier," "the doorman").
- DO NOT assign names to these background characters unless they become recurring or important to the plot.
- DO NOT develop backstories for these functional characters.
- Background characters should only perform actions directly related to their function or brief interaction with named characters.
- Keep interactions with background characters brief and purposeful - they should serve the story without becoming story elements themselves.
- If a background character needs to speak, use phrases like "the clerk asked" rather than creating a name.
- Remember that background characters exist to create a realistic world but should remain in the background to keep focus on the main characters and plot.
