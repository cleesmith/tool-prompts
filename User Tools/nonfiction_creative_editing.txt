Thoroughly complete the following 2 TASKS for CREATIVE/LITERARY NON-FICTION:

=== TASK 1: ARTISTIC INTEGRITY ANALYSIS ===

You are an expert editor specializing in creative and literary non-fiction. 
Analyze the MANUSCRIPT to identify elements that undermine the work's artistic authenticity, voice consistency, or emotional resonance.

Focus on:

1. VOICE AND AUTHENTICITY:
   - Moments where the author's voice feels forced, artificial, or inconsistent with the established tone
   - Insights or reflections that seem manufactured rather than genuinely discovered
   - Shifts in narrative persona that feel jarring or unmotivated
   - Language that sounds borrowed from other writers rather than authentically the author's own

2. METAPHORICAL INTEGRITY:
   - Connections between paired elements that feel forced or intellectually constructed rather than intuitively discovered
   - Metaphors that break down when examined or don't sustain their internal logic
   - Symbolic interpretations that seem imposed from outside rather than emerging from the material
   - Overextended analogies that lose their power through excessive elaboration

3. EMOTIONAL HONESTY:
   - Reflections that claim depth or significance they haven't earned through the writing
   - Spiritual insights that feel generic or borrowed rather than personally lived
   - Emotional moments that seem performed rather than genuinely felt
   - Conclusions that arrive too easily without sufficient exploration of complexity or doubt

4. STRUCTURAL COHERENCE:
   - Individual pieces that don't contribute to the overall arc or vision of the work
   - Repetitive patterns that become predictable rather than building meaning
   - Missing connections between pieces that could strengthen the cumulative effect
   - Inconsistencies in the experimental method or approach that confuse rather than intrigue

For each issue found, provide:
- The specific problem with exact manuscript locations
- Why it diminishes the artistic or emotional impact
- A suggested approach for revision that honors the creative intent


=== TASK 2: RESONANCE AND COMPLETION ANALYSIS ===

You are an expert editor focusing on the emotional and spiritual impact of literary non-fiction. Analyze the MANUSCRIPT to identify where the work could deepen its resonance or achieve greater completeness.

1. UNREALIZED POTENTIAL:
   - Metaphorical pairings that could yield richer insights with deeper exploration
   - Personal revelations that are touched on but not fully developed
   - Spiritual or philosophical threads that could be woven more explicitly through the work
   - Moments of genuine discovery that could be expanded or deepened

2. CUMULATIVE IMPACT:
   - Missing connections between individual pieces that could strengthen the overall experience
   - Patterns or themes that emerge but aren't fully explored or articulated
   - Opportunities for the work to build toward greater meaning or revelation
   - Ways the experimental constraint could be more fully explored or evolved

3. READER EXPERIENCE:
   - Places where readers might lose engagement or feel distanced from the material
   - Opportunities to invite deeper contemplation or personal reflection
   - Missing guidance for readers who want to apply this approach in their own lives
   - Moments where the writing could be more generous in sharing insight or vulnerability

4. ARTISTIC COMPLETENESS:
   - Questions raised by the work that deserve further exploration
   - Philosophical implications that could be more fully developed
   - The relationship between form and content that could be made more explicit
   - Ways the ending could provide greater sense of completion or transformation

For each area of unrealized potential, provide:
- What deeper possibility exists and where in the manuscript
- How developing this element would serve the work's artistic vision
- Suggested approaches that maintain the work's contemplative and experimental nature

IMPORTANT:
- Prioritize authentic spiritual and emotional insight over intellectual cleverness
- Evaluate whether metaphorical connections feel genuinely discovered rather than constructed
- Consider the cumulative effect and overall reading experience, not just individual pieces
- Respect the experimental and contemplative nature of the work
- Focus on deepening resonance rather than adding external validation or proof
