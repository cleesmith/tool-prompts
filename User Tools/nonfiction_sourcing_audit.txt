Nonfiction Sourcing Audit

GOAL: Systematically identify factual claims that require better sourcing or verification before publication, prioritizing high-risk assertions that could cause harm if incorrect.

HIGH-PRIORITY CLAIMS (review these first):
- Medical, health, or safety recommendations without authoritative backing
- Legal advice or regulatory guidance lacking proper citation  
- Financial recommendations or investment advice without credible sources
- Claims about vulnerable populations without research support
- Emergency procedures or crisis response information

STANDARD REVIEW ITEMS:
- Vague sourcing language ("studies show," "experts say," "research indicates")
- Specific statistics, percentages, dates, or quotes without citations
- Claims about current events lacking date-specific sources
- Internal contradictions between different sections
- Outdated information in rapidly changing fields

SOURCE QUALITY TIERS:
- TIER 1 (Highest): Peer-reviewed journals, government agencies, established medical institutions, official statistics, primary legal documents
- TIER 2 (Moderate): Major news outlets with editorial standards, recognized research organizations, authoritative industry reports
- TIER 3 (Questionable): Personal blogs, social media, commercial sites with conflicts of interest, sources over 5 years old in fast-changing fields

AUDIT PROCESS:
1. Extract each factual assertion from the text
2. Verify supporting sources using available resources
3. Check internal consistency across all claims
4. Assess source currency and potential bias
5. Categorize findings using status codes below

SOURCE STATUS CODES:
- VERIFIED: Current, credible source directly supports claim
- PARTIAL: Relevant source found but with limited scope or different parameters  
- OUTDATED: Source located but may no longer be current
- CONFLICTING: Multiple sources with contradictory information
- UNSOURCED: No adequate supporting source identified
- INTERNAL CONFLICT: Inconsistency within the manuscript

AUDIT REPORT FORMAT:

HIGH-PRIORITY FINDINGS
Claim | Status Code | Recommended Source | Risk Assessment | Action Required

STANDARD FINDINGS  
Claim | Status Code | Recommended Source | Notes

VERIFICATION RECOMMENDATIONS
- List specific steps for addressing UNSOURCED, CONFLICTING, OUTDATED, or INTERNAL CONFLICT items
- Suggest removal or revision of unsupported high-risk claims
- Provide alternative phrasing for partially supported statements
- Recommend consultation with subject matter experts where needed

AUDIT LIMITATIONS:
This sourcing audit relies on automated analysis with restricted access to specialized databases and recent publications. Authors must independently verify all claims through primary research, especially high-priority assertions. For complex technical, medical, or legal content, consultation with qualified experts is essential before publication.
