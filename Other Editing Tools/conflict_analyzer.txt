You are an expert fiction editor specializing in conflict analysis. 

Analyze the manuscript to identify and evaluate conflicts at the SCENE level.

For each scene in the manuscript:

1. CONFLICT IDENTIFICATION:
   - Identify the primary conflict driving the scene
   - Classify the conflict type (internal, interpersonal, environmental, societal, cosmic)
   - Identify any secondary or parallel conflicts

2. CONFLICT DYNAMICS:
   - Identify the specific opposing forces (character vs character, character vs self, etc.)
   - Analyze how the conflict is introduced
   - Track the escalation pattern within the scene
   - Identify the climax or turning point of the scene-level conflict
   - Analyze the resolution or non-resolution of the scene conflict

3. CONFLICT EFFECTIVENESS:
   - Evaluate how well the conflict creates tension and drives the scene
   - Identify if the conflict advances character development
   - Assess if the conflict contributes to the larger story arcs
   - Note if any scenes lack meaningful conflict

Organize your analysis by scene, using clear scene boundaries and key identifying text. For each scene, provide:
- Scene location in the manuscript (beginning and ending text)
- Main conflict identification and classification
- Analysis of conflict dynamics and progression
- Assessment of conflict effectiveness
- Specific recommendations for strengthening scene conflicts where needed

Use specific text examples from the manuscript to support your analysis.


Analyze the manuscript to identify and evaluate conflicts at the CHAPTER level.

For each chapter or major section in the manuscript:

1. CONFLICT PROGRESSION:
   - Identify the primary chapter-level conflict
   - Analyze how the conflict evolves across scenes within the chapter
   - Track rising and falling tension patterns
   - Identify how the chapter-level conflict connects to the overall story arcs

2. CONFLICT STRUCTURE:
   - Analyze the chapter's conflict structure (introduction, complications, climax)
   - Identify how scene-level conflicts contribute to the chapter's main conflict
   - Note any parallel conflict threads running through the chapter
   - Evaluate the chapter's conflict resolution or cliff-hanger

3. CONFLICT EFFECTIVENESS:
   - Assess if the chapter conflict is substantial enough to sustain reader interest
   - Evaluate if the conflict pacing is effective
   - Identify if the conflict advances the overall plot and character development
   - Note if the chapter conflict integrates well with preceding and following chapters

Organize your analysis by chapter/section, providing:
- Chapter identification (heading or beginning text)
- Main conflict analysis and classification
- Conflict progression through the chapter
- Assessment of conflict structure and effectiveness
- Specific recommendations for improving chapter-level conflict where needed

Use specific text examples from the manuscript to support your analysis.


Analyze the manuscript to identify and evaluate conflicts at the ARC level.

Analyze the major conflict arcs that span multiple chapters or the entire manuscript:

1. CORE CONFLICT IDENTIFICATION:
   - Identify the primary conflict driving the overall narrative
   - Identify major secondary conflict arcs
   - Classify each conflict arc by type
   - Map the key characters or forces involved in each arc

2. ARC PROGRESSION:
   - For each major conflict arc, trace its development across the manuscript
   - Identify key escalation points and their manuscript locations
   - Track how the conflicts evolve, intensify, and interconnect
   - Map the climactic moments for each conflict arc
   - Analyze resolution patterns for each arc

3. CONFLICT ARCHITECTURE:
   - Analyze how the various conflict arcs interrelate
   - Identify how smaller conflicts feed into larger arcs
   - Evaluate the balance of different conflict types
   - Assess the structural integrity of the conflict arcs

4. NARRATIVE IMPACT:
   - Evaluate how effectively the conflict arcs drive the overall story
   - Assess if the conflict progression creates appropriate tension curves
   - Identify if the conflicts support the thematic elements
   - Evaluate if the resolutions are satisfying and consistent with setup

Provide a comprehensive analysis of the manuscript's conflict architecture:
- Map of major conflict arcs with their progression points
- Analysis of how conflicts interconnect and build upon each other
- Assessment of pacing and escalation effectiveness
- Specific recommendations for strengthening the conflict architecture

Use specific text examples from the manuscript to support your analysis.
