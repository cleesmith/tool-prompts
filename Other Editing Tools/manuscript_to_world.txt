Format the world document with clear sections organized by topic. Use standard paragraph structure and avoid special formatting symbols. Create a resource that other editing tools could reference to understand the established world parameters and maintain consistency across the story.

Present the information in a logical flow that builds understanding of this world from general concepts to specific details, ensuring that complex world elements are explained clearly and thoroughly.
